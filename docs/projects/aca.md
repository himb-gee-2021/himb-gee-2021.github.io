# Accessing Allen Coral Atlas

The Allen Coral Atlas (ACA) has enabled mapping corals at a global scale and is a massive undertaking from model development, testing to validation and implementation. The Atlas which is a dynamic map allows users to interact query, search and download data for analysis and apply it to enrich their own datasets as needed.

I recently wrote a [medium post describing how to search for and interact with the Allen Coral Atlas and you can read it here.](https://samapriyaroy.medium.com/chasing-coral-data-fd872809c271)

For the purpose of this course, these datasets were directly made available within Google Earth Engine generously by the ACA team. The [base code and descriptions of coral assets provided can be found here](https://github.com/himb-gee-2021/coral-atlas-assets)
